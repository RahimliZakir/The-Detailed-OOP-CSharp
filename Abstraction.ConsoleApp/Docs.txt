- C# Abstraction
The process of representing the essential features without including the background details is called Abstraction. 
In simple words, we can say that it is a process of defining a class by providing the necessary details to call 
the object operations (i.e., methods) by hiding its implementation details. 
It is called abstraction in C#. It means we need to expose what is necessary and compulsory, 
and we need to hide unnecessary things from the outside world.
Programmatically, we can define abstraction as the process of hiding implementation details of the 
object’s feature and showing only the essential information of the feature to the user. 
Abstraction lets you focus more on what an object does rather than how it does.
