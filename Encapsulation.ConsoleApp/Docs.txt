- C# Encapsulation
The Encapsulation Principle in C# is very similar to a Capsule. 
As a capsule binds its medicine within it, in the same way in C#, the Encapsulation Principle binds the 
State (Variables) and Behaviour (Methods) into a single unit called class, enum, interface, etc. 
So, you can think of Encapsulation as a cover or layer that binds related states and behavior together in a single unit.

- Every class, interface, struct, enum, etc. that we created is an example of encapsulation!

- What is Data (Information) Hiding in C#?
Data hiding or Information Hiding is a Process in which we hide internal data from outside the world. 
The purpose of data hiding is to protect the data from misuse by the outside world. 
Data hiding is also known as Data Encapsulation. Without the Encapsulation Principle, we cannot achieve data hiding.

- How can we Implement Data Hiding or Data Encapsulation in C#?
1. By declaring the variables as private (to restrict their direct access from outside the class)
2. By defining one pair of public setter and getter methods or properties to access private variables from outside the class.
