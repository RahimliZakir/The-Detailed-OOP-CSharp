- C# Polymorphism
The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many forms. It is a greek word. 
In object-oriented programming, we use 3 main concepts: inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism.
Polymorphism simply means occurring in more than one form.
That is, the same entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.

-Types of Polymorphism
There are two types of polymorphism:
1. Compile Time Polymorphism / Static Polymorphism
2. Run-Time Polymorphism / Dynamic Polymorphism

- 1. Compile Time (Static) Polymorphism
• Method overloading
• Operator overloading

- 2. Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism
• Method Overriding
  Bonuses:
    • Method Hiding
    • Method Shadowing
